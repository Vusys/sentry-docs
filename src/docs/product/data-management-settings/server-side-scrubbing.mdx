If you cannot - or do not want to - <PlatformLink to="/data-management/sensitive-data/">scrub data within the SDK</PlatformLink>, Sentry provides a number of options to achieve this in the product itself. You'll find these settings under the **Data Scrubber** option within both your Organization and individual Project settings. By default this is enabled, and we highly recommend you keep it that way. With it enabled, Sentry will scrub the following:

- Values that look like they contain credit cards (using a basic regular expression)
- Values that themselves contain, or whose keynames contain, any of the following strings:
  - password
  - secret
  - passwd
  - api_key
  - apikey
  - access_token
  - auth_token
  - credentials
  - mysql_pwd
  - stripetoken
  - card[number]
- Any keys which match values that you’ve added to the list of additional fields in your Project Settings.

Sentry will redact arrays and literal values, but not entire objects. For example:

```bash
credentials = {
  username: 'jane',
  cats: ['pancake', 'maple', 'hellboy']
  password: 'p4ssw0rd!',
  lastLogin: 'yesterday',
  ...
}
```

Using the default options would not cause the _object_ `credentials` to be redacted in its entirety; rather, all of its entries would be subject to scrubbing. So `password` would be redacted by default, and adding `cats`, `username`, and/or `lastLogin` to the list of additional fields would cause those values to be redacted as well.

<Note>

You can choose to expand the keys which are scrubbed by the server, as well as prevent IP addresses from being stored. The latter is particularly important if you’re concerned about PII and using our Browser JavaScript SDK.

</Note>

In addition, we provide an [_Advanced Data Scrubbing_](advanced-datascrubbing/) feature which allows more control over how filters are applied..

## Removing Data

If you’ve accidentally sent sensitive data to the server it’s likely you’re not going to want to leave it there. There are a few things to note in removal:

- If you send it as a tagged value, removing the event is not enough. You can visit Project Settings and under Tags you’ll find a way to permanently remove any related data for a given tag.
- While you cannot delete a single event, you can delete the issue the event is in by clicking the trash icon on the issue details page.
- If you send sparse events to a project (potentially all of them), your only option is to remove the project and re-create it. Keep in mind this will revoke API credentials, so you likely want to do this in the reverse order.
