As with any third-party service it’s important to understand what data is being sent to Sentry, and where relevant ensure sensitive data either never reaches the Sentry servers, or at the very least it doesn’t get stored.

While we recommend <PlatformLink to="/data-management/sensitive-data/">filtering or scrubbing sensitive data within the SDK</PlatformLink>, so that data is not sent with the event, you can also configure [server-side scrubbing](product/basic-data-scrubbing/) to ensure the data is not stored. In addition, [Advanced Data Scrubbing](/product/advanced-datascrubbing/) is an alternative way to redact sensitive information just before it is saved in Sentry. It allows you to:

- Define custom regular expressions to match on sensitive data
- Detailed tuning on which parts of an event to scrub
- Partial removal or hashing of sensitive data instead of deletion

There are two great examples for data scrubbing that every company should think about:

- PII (Personally Identifiable Information) such as a user's name or email address, which post-GDPR should be on every company's mind.
- Authentication credentials, like your AWS password or key.
- Confidential IP (Intellectual Property), such as your favorite color, or your upcoming plans for world domination.
